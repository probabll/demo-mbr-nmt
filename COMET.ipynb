    "The utility function is anything we trust for assessing the merits of a translation candidate. In this part of the demo, we will employ a modern NN-based metric: [COMET](https://github.com/Unbabel/COMET). Some of COMET's dependencies are in conflict with our trained NMT models (e.g., fairseq version), thus we have prepared a flask that abstracts away from all the mess behind maintaining different versions of python packages: git clone Probabll's [mteval-flask](https://github.com/probabll/mteval-flask) and follow the instructions there to start an automatic evaluation server. \n",
